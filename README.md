Tesla Website Replica

This project is a replica of the Tesla website that I created to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It was an engaging experience for me as it involved implementing innovative features and focusing on UI/UX design principles.

Purpose

The main goal of this project was to improve my frontend development skills by recreating a modern and interactive website. 
While this version is functional, there are still areas that need fixing and additional features that I plan to add in the future.

Features

HTML: Used to structure the content of the website.

CSS: Styled the website to closely match the Tesla website's design.

JavaScript: Implemented interactive elements and animations for a dynamic user experience.


Next Steps

Moving forward, I aim to enhance this project by:

Addressing any existing issues and bugs.
Adding more interactive features to improve user engagement.
Optimizing the website for different devices and screen sizes.
